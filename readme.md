## ⚙️ Requirements

| Component         | Version/Notes                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| PowerShell        | 5.1+ or PowerShell Core 7.x       |
| Ollama            | [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com) |
| Mistral Model     | Run `ollama pull mistral`         |
| Git (optional)    | For version control/backups       |

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **AI Script Merging**  
Use `Ollama` + `Mistral` to intelligently consolidate multiple `*arsenal*.sh` or `.ps1` scripts into a single optimized output.

✅ **Automatic Backup**  
Files being overwritten are automatically backed up with timestamped filenames.

✅ **Safe Deletion**  
Prompted confirmation before permanently removing original scripts.

✅ **Logging**  
All actions (copied files, backups, failures) are logged to `arsenal_copy.log`.

✅ **Modular Design**  
Easily extend with `.bat`, `.py`, or `.cmd` arsenal scripts by adjusting `$Patterns`.

---

## 📜 Usage

### 🔹 Copy Arsenal Scripts

```powershell
.\copy_arsenal_installer.ps1
This will:

Recursively scan C:\Users\MSI\Developments for any script matching *arsenal*

Copy it to C:\Users\MSI\Developments\master_installers

Backup any overwritten file

Log all operations to arsenal_copy.log

🔹 Merge Arsenal Bash Scripts (AI-Powered)
powershell
Copy
Edit
.\ollama_merge_arsenal.ps1
This will:

Find all *arsenal*.sh scripts under the current directory

Send their contents to Ollama Mistral to intelligently merge and optimize

Save the result to: merged_arsenal.sh

Prompt you to delete the originals after successful merge

💡 This script can be extended to merge .ps1, .py, or .bat versions as needed.

📂 Output Location
By default, all merged and copied outputs are placed in:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\MSI\Developments\master_installers
You can change this by modifying the $TargetDir variable in the scripts.

🧠 AI Merging Philosophy
We leverage Ollama's Mistral model for:

Functional deduplication

Structural cleanup

Semantic merging of similar or related functions

Intelligent script commenting

This prevents manual merging of scattered logic and ensures maintainable, production-grade results.

📌 Notes & Best Practices
Run scripts in a clean terminal with admin rights if needed

Always check the merged output before deleting originals

Use Git to version merged_arsenal.sh or .ps1 outputs

Extend $Patterns in copy_arsenal_installer.ps1 to capture more file types

🧩 Next Up: Enhancements
Planned features for future versions:

 Git version tagging per merge

 Build-ArsenalPackage.ps1 to zip and deploy a release

 Cron/task scheduler support

 Auto-validate merged Bash syntax via bash -n

Perfect — let’s rework this for Linux. You’ll get a full README.md for the Linux Arsenal Installer Pipeline, with support for:

Merging *arsenal*.sh scripts via Ollama + Mistral

Copying arsenal-related Bash scripts into a central directory

Logging actions and backing up overwritten files

Fully CLI-native, no PowerShell required

## 🧱 Requirements

| Component       | Version / Command |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Bash            | Standard Linux Shell |
| Ollama          | `ollama run mistral` must work |
| Mistral Model   | `ollama pull mistral` |
| `find`, `cp`, `read`, `tee` | Standard utilities |

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Copy Arsenal Scripts

```bash
./copy_arsenal_installer.sh
Scans the current directory and subdirectories for *arsenal*.sh

Copies them to ./master_installers/

Backs up overwritten files

Logs all operations to arsenal_copy.log

2️⃣ AI Merge Arsenal Scripts
bash
Copy
Edit
./merge_arsenal_ai.sh
Concatenates contents of all *arsenal*.sh files

Sends it to ollama run mistral with a merging prompt

Saves merged output to master_installers/merged_arsenal.sh

Prompts you to confirm deletion of originals

⚠️ You must have ollama running and Mistral model pulled.

📂 Output Location
By default, all results are stored in:

bash
Copy
Edit
./master_installers/
You can customize this by editing the TARGET_DIR variable at the top of each script.

🛡️ Safety Features
✔️ Backs up files before overwriting (timestamped)

✔️ Asks before deleting original files

✔️ Writes all logs to a persistent arsenal_copy.log

🔧 Customization
You can easily extend this by changing:

FILE_PATTERN in copy_arsenal_installer.sh (e.g., to *.bash or *.py)

The AI prompt in merge_arsenal_ai.sh to change the merging logic

🧠 Why Use Ollama?
Merging 5–10 shell scripts manually is tedious and error-prone.
Mistral can:

Consolidate redundant logic

Comment sections

Restructure functions

Output clean, working Bash

It's like having an expert script engineer available 24/7.

🧪 Example
After running both scripts:

bash
Copy
Edit
master_installers/
├── merged_arsenal.sh
├── recon_arsenal_backup_20250723_172811.sh
├── exfil_arsenal.sh
├── arsenal_copy.log
🧩 Future Features
 Git-based versioning of merged outputs

 .deb package generation for merged tools

 Scheduled nightly arsenal sync/merge

 LLM merging for Python, Go, JS tools

Would you like me to now:

- Generate the matching `merge_arsenal_ai.sh` and `copy_arsenal_installer.sh` Linux scripts?
- Bundle this into a `.tar.gz` deployment package with logging and symlinks?

Say the word and I’ll drop the rest.
